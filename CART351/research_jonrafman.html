            Dream Journal is the new exposition made by Jon Rafman, a Canadian multimedia artist from Montreal. <br><br>

            Jon Rafman is known for bringing forward mysteries from the deep web. <br><br>

            Dream Journal gives us an image of the internet that goes past the memes and other kitch social media aesthetics. <br><br>

            It rather shows us the violent, disturbing, erotic, perverse and sometimes beautiful parts of it. <br><br>

            The piece is an hour-long video with an "impossibly long" story, accompanied by a track by Oneohtrix Point Never. <br><br>
            The aesthetic is ambiguous, and esoteric. It goes in every direction and follows no apparent logic. However, the objects and actions are all very clear and understandable, and use what Rafman calls "the language of the internet" <br><br>

            The artist describes it as such: "it uses very primitive animation software, but with it, you can respond very quickly, like the way that the internet responds to culture and politics." <br><br>

            His work touches the fast-paced and saturated world we live in: "in an age of ADD, there's a sense in which immersion speaks on a critical level to what is required to completely emcompass a viewer.
            With BR, you're blindfolded. With IMAX theaters, you might have vibrating chairs... I'm reflecting a time in which one almost arrest the viewer in a violent way." <br><br>
