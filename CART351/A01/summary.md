My goal for this first assignment was to remix the piece My Boyfriend Came Back From The War, by Olia Lialina, published in 1994. Her original piece is about PTSD, and captures a very anxious stream of thoughts displayed onto numerous frames.

While keeping the subject matter my own and focus on my personal experiences, I aimed to keep the same style: short, uncontextualized fragments of thoughts. Cryptic pictures that fade into the background and, most importantly, parallel branches of inner dialogue.

Remaking the piece turned out to be a bigger challenge that I thought since most of the functions she uses for the piece are now deprecated in HTML5. I especially had to come up with new ways to use subdividing windows, which led me to compromises: it is no longer possible to resize windows like in the original scene, but on the bright side, the unresizable frame progression enabled a new idea: a deconstructed image will slowly show up as the experience comes to an end.
