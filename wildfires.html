    <p class="BioSubtitle">today i found out what my biggest fear was.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i never knew how to answer that question but i think i now have an answer.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">my biggest fear is to grow bitter.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">become a sad angry man.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">blaming everything and the sky while living out their best days picking imaginary fights at people in their head.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">whoever hurt me are scared or angry or both.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle"> as i am.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i won't further enable that misery. i won't go to war.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">whoever they are i'll keep loving them as i used to.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll love them and no one has to know.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll get angry as long as it's the kind that fades.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll not let that build up like sediment in a cave.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i only want to love and claw my way out to keep loving and desiring and growing and searching.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'm fine with searing and scorching like a wildfire.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">that's less deadwood and more saplings.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'm looking forward to it. i'm not scared of burning i'm only scared of misgrowing.</p>
