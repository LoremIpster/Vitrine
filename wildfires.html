    <p class="BioSubtitle">today i found out what my biggest fear was.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i never knew how to answer that question but i think i found out today.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">my biggest fear is to grow bitter.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">become a sad angry man.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">blaming everything and the sky while living out their best days picking imaginary fights at people in their head.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">whoever hurt me are scared or angry or both.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle"> as i am.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i don't want to further enable that misery. i don't want to go to war.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">the people who wronged me, i'll keep loving them as i used to.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll love them and no one has to know.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll get angry as long as it's the kind that fades after a dozen breaths. nothing lasts forever.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'll not let that build up like sediment in a cave.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i only want to love and claw my way out to keep loving, and growing, and searching.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'm fine with burning like these catastrophic wildfires.</p>

    <p class="BioSubtitle">i'm looking forward to it. i'm not scared of burning i'm only scared of misgrowing.</p>
